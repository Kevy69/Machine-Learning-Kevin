General:
    Stuff one can do:
        Load Data
        Train test split
        Standardize data (feature scaling)

        linear/multiple regression

        polynomial regression (Arbitrarily add features)
        Regulirazation

        logistic regression
    

    False positive (FP) = falsely saying its positive. Saying patient has cancer, while he doesn't
    False negative (FN) = falsely saying its negative. Saying patient doesn't have cancer, while he does
    True positive (TP) = truly saying its positive. Saying patient has cancer, when he does.
    True negative (TN) = truly saying its negative. Saying patient doesn't have cancer, while he doesn't.

    accuracy = Part devided by whole.
    recall = TP/(TP+FN)
    precision = TP/(TP+FP)

    sensitivity = How often the test show a positive result, while patient has cancer.
    specificity = How often the test show a negative result, while patient doesn't have cancer.


polynomial regression:
    degree = increasing powers, getting more none linear
    order = dimentionality.
